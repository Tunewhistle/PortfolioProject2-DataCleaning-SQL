# PortfolioProject2-DataCleaning-SQL
This is a **Data Cleanning** project in sql, the purpose of this exercise was to organize the raw data to make it more usable.

Some of the cleaning in this exercises are:

* Convert a column's datatype (ex. from datatime to date);

* Autofill "NULL" with values by taking other rows' values as references;

* Break out one column into two or more columns(ex. break values in column Address into three new columns (Address, City, State));

* Replace "Y" with "Yes" and "N" with "No";

* Delete duplicate rows and delete unused columns.

**Feel Free to check out the detailed queries in the SQL file.**
